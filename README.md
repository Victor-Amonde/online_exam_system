#About Online Examination System Python Django Project
This online exam system project in Python Django focuses mainly on dealing with student’s examinations. Also, the system displays all the available course and their question sets. In addition, the system allows managing question set by entering questions, options, and answers. This project is divided into three categories: Student, Teacher, and Admin Panel. In an overview of this web application, a student can simply register and start using it. Here, the system displays all the exams for the student. And the student can proceed to attend their examinations. All the exams are of MCQ type. After submission of answers, the student can view his/her marks with their number of attempts under respective courses. The system also counts the number of attempts a student takes in order to complete the exam.

#Teacher Panel
Talking about the teacher panel, each and every user needs approval from the administration in order to activate their accounts. Once after getting approval, he/she can access the system and manage courses with their question sets. For adding courses, the teacher has to enter the course name, total questions, and marks. Similarly, the same goes for the management of questions. He/she has to select a course, enter questions, total marks, and four options with the correct answer. For the rest, the teacher has a limit up to this point of accessing the system, but he/she can view the total number of students.

#Admin Panel
On the other hand, an admin has full control of the system. An admin manages the flow of the system, unlike every other user. The user can have an overview of each data. The admin has the right to approve/decline the teacher’s account. After approving the request, he/she can set up the salary of the teachers. Just like the teacher’s role, an admin can easily manage courses and question sets. Additionally, the admin can view each student’s total obtained marks from each course. All the steps are similar to the above in terms of managing the course and question sets. Besides, the admin can manage their students, teachers, and teacher’s salary record. In this way, these roles help in maintaining the proper flow of the system. And all the answers are checked by the system automatically.
